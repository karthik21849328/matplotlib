# matplotlib

In this module, I've acquired knowledge about various plot types available in Matplotlib, including line plots, bar plots, pie charts, histograms, and box plots. These visualization techniques serve distinct purposes in data analysis:

Line plots: Visualize relationships between two continuous variables over a continuous interval, commonly used for displaying trends over time.

Bar plots: Compare categorical data by illustrating the frequency or distribution of each category using rectangular bars, aiding in visual comparisons between different groups.

Pie charts: Represent numerical proportions of categorical data as slices within a circular graphic, useful for illustrating the composition of parts within a whole.

Histograms: Display the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing the data into intervals (bins) and showing the frequency or count of observations in each bin, providing insights into the data's shape and spread.

Box plots (Box-and-whisker plots): Depict the distribution of a continuous variable by displaying key summary statistics like median, quartiles, and outliers, facilitating comparisons between distributions or groups.
